I am currently a PhD student of biology at the University of Ostrava. My project revolves mostly around evolutionary genomics of a really weird fish - European loaches, which hybridize between species, lose sex like car keys, then switch to clonality like no big deal, find and keep foreign genomes just in case, and otherwise spend most of their days pretending to be sand.

But I'm interested in everything evolutionary!
