The title of this blog - What is Life - was inspired by a book of the same name, written by Erwin Schrödinger in 1944.

> The legend has it that this book had an important influence on James Watson and Francis Crick, who allegedly read the book right before they discovered ~~the notebooks of Rosalind Franklin~~ the double helix structure of DNA.

What actually happened back then is still hotly debated in many corners of the internet. This blog however circles back to the Schrödinger's original question and tries to explore it further. Since this is rather a long-term hunt, I will interrupt the silence with occasional posts on computer biology and other topics that I find interesting.
